adding a keyword global in front of the variable inside a function
makes it a global variable and merely copies the address of the 
original variable outside the function
usage of global variable is a bad thing because it
 creates a lot of dependencies.
functions are first class entities which means assignment can be 
done like other kinds of objects
functions can be even passed to other functions
its called higher order function
