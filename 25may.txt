starting with python 
start off with the python practice book
wget command helps to download files without the browser 
wget <url>

tar xvf <file name> to open a .tgz file 

python is a dynamically typed languages which means there is no variable declarations as such and type is assigned during run time 
developed by guido von rossum 
REPL : Read,Evaluate,Print,Loop
python has repl 
which means python reads first evaluates them, prints them
 and starts all over again waiting for the next input 
python is white space sensitive 
either use tab or multiple space 
the problem with dynamic typing iss the errors are 
caught only in run time and not in compile time.
inspite of having error in the else part which will
 not be executed it still showed a syntax error. how  ? 


compilation and execution model of a python program 

a) compilation into a byte code
------------------------------------ 

check for the syntactical errors according to the pythonic grammar 
converts it into a machine code but wont run on a processor
we call such machine code byte code or virtual machine code 

why wont it run  ? 

eg: in an x86 processor a function to add ax and bx --->
 corresponding code is 80. 
for arm it will be add r1, r2 -- > code might be 90
what byte code that python generates will not be either 80 or
 90 and hence wont work  

why is it called virtual machine code ? 

The python programming language defines an abstract machine
which means something you dont get it in market or it can 
be called a hypothetical cpu 

why virtual cpu  ? 
its a classical programming language design strategy 
eg in java also 
specific advantage being : makes the language platform
 independent
 
 
b) byte code interpretation 

read the byte code and run the commands mentioned in the byte
 code  using c code.

how to see the intermediate byte code file ? 
take python 
type import <file name> and come out of python
