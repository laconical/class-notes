simple OOPS with a bank account example 
dictionary and class have a very similar use without the class methods
dictionary does not crate a new type and to do that we need class 
classes give a much more solid representation of an entity 
they bind actions with a type 

constructor functions :

def _init_(self): means this function gets initialised when the object is created 
this is used to properly initialise the object
member functions are always called with the object. 
they can be called with the class name as well but it is not generally followed

scope :

variables are binded to objects only with the objectname.variablename format
to understand the binding we need to understand whether the variable is bound to the class or the object
local variables always shadow the effects of global variables 
variables can be declared and assigned in class as attributes and can be called only with the classname.variablename format
