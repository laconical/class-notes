	-----------

composition and inheritance are the two central ideas of oop

combine classes/object -- > more complex stuff 

real world entities will often be related to each other 
a)	has a relation modelled by composition, doesnt require huge syntax 
b) 	is a relation  modelled by inheritance 

class encapsulates data and behaviour

use of multiple inheritance is highly discouraged
