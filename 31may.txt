a=[1,2,3,4]
2 in a checks for membership
a.sort() mutates the list to a sorted list 
sorted(a)doesnt mutate the list 

list comprehension
-----------------
[x*x for x in a if x%2 == 0] returns a modified list 

this is a list comprehension

the pythonic style
-----------------
for repetition
a) try list comprehension
b) for loop
c) while loop 

a,b = (1,2)
is called unpacking a tuple
tuple is immutable
zip function 
-----------

a= [1,3,5]
b=[2,4,6]
zip(a,b) regroups it as a different tuple

nested comprehensions gives permutation upon itself 
t=[(u,v)for u in a for v in a]
nested comprehension with a selection
t=[(u,v)for u in a for v in a if (u-v)=1]

dictionary
----------
a= {'abc':10,'def':20}
comes in key-value pairs 
heterogenous 
mutable 
no ordering 
none - pythonic blank 
tuple keys have to be immutable 
values can be anything 

look up : hash table 

del a('abc') deletes the key
