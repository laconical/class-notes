in python 3 map function doesnt cause buffer overload because instead of returning a list in map function it returns an object which means computation is done on demand 
range function also the same way only stores the starting and ending points 

closures
----------

python has nested functions 
fun 1 has fun2 inside the function 
you cannot call fun 2 outside because of limited scope issues 

when fun2 is called by assigning it to a diff variable, it wll be able to acess its parrent function variable

functions like fun2 are called closures
they have captured some values from the outside environment 

a function taking n arguments can be written as n-times nested function. This is called a curried invocation 

use of closures
--------------

differentiation and integration are examples of higher order mathematical functions 
where functions
