 part 1

exception handling 
array limit exceeding  
division by zero etc are examples of exceptions 
so extra ordinary situations like these are called exceptions
most exceptions result in termination of the program unless we use some lind of exception handling 

try : 
	................
	....................
except : 
	............. 
	.........
once except block is implemented, exception is said to
  be handled
